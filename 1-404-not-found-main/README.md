### What was your experience

- It didn't took alot of time, due to the help of preparing to strategies from the begining, of course that was after learning more about html and css from some ressources such as [LinkedIn](https://opportunity.linkedin.com/skills-for-in-demand-jobs). 
- The path went through designing for the Phone screen first then handeling the large screens, the font are set in "vh" size, the organization of elements are under Flex-boxes and Grids
